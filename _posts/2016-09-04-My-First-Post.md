Hello people who will be reading my blog.

The purpose of this blog will be to share my experiences in being a developer, tips as well as tutorials to try to help and give back.

All of the content and any opinions on this blog are my own and do not the opinions of my employers.


As a convention I will be using the following formatting in my blog to make things easier for people to under stand.

Linux and Bash Scripts
```
echo 'Welcome to my blog'
```

Python and Django
```python
print("Welcome to my blog")
```

Javascript and Jquery
```javascript
console.log("Welcome to my blog")
```

MySQL and PostGreSQL
```sql
Create table blog(
  post_name text not null
);
insert into blog values ('Welcome to my blog');
select post_name from blog;
```

Thank you very much and feel free to contact me any time.
